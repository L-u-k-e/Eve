# Eve
Eve's gift to Earth is a supercharged verison of `createElement()`. 

Rather than simply taking a tag name, this function takes an object that represents a more complete version of the element you are envisioning. 

This allows you to create your element, assign multiple properties and set multiple attributes on it in a single statement. Additionally, Eve supports recursion, so you can add children/grand-children/... of the same complexity.

It allows you to craft elements more akin to the way they are crafted in standardHTML.
